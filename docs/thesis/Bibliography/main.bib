abstract = {We investigate five different models to reconstruct the 3D y-ray hit coordinates in five large LaCl3(Ce) monolithic crystals optically coupled to pixelated silicon photomultipliers. These scintillators have a base surface of 50 x 50 mm2 and five different thicknesses, from 10 mm to 30 mm. Four of these models are analytical prescriptions and one is based on a Convolutional Neural Network. Average resolutions close to 1-2 mm fwhm are obtained in the transverse crystal plane for crystal thicknesses between 10 mm and 20 mm using analytical models. For thicker crystals average resolutions of about 3-5 mm fwhm are obtained. Depth of interaction resolutions between 1 mm and 4 mm are achieved depending on the distance of the interaction point to the photosensor surface. We propose a Machine Learning algorithm to correct for linearity distortions and pin-cushion effects. The latter allows one to keep a large field of view of about 70\%-80\% of the crystal surface, regardless of crystal thickness. This work is aimed at optimizing the performance of the so-called Total Energy Detector with Compton imaging capability (i-TED) for time-of-flight neutron capture cross-section measurements.}

abstract = {We report on the spatial response characterization of large LaCl3(Ce) monolithic crystals optically coupled to 8 x 8 pixel silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) sensors. A systematic study has been carried out for 511 keV y-rays using three different crystal thicknesses of 10 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm, all of them with planar geometry and a base size of 50 x 50 mm2. In this work we investigate and compare two different approaches for the determination of the main y-ray hit location. On one hand, methods based on the fit of an analytical model for the scintillation light distribution provide the best results in terms of linearity and field of view, with spatial resolutions close to ~1 mm fwhm. On the other hand, position reconstruction techniques based on neural networks provide similar linearity and field-of-view, becoming the attainable spatial resolution ~3 mm fwhm. For the third space coordinate z or depth-of-interaction we have implemented an inverse linear calibration approach based on the cross-section of the measured scintillation-light distribution at a certain height. The detectors characterized in this work are intended for the development of so-called Total Energy Detectors with Compton imaging capability (i-TED), aimed at enhanced sensitivity and selectivity measurements of neutron capture cross sections via the time-of-flight (TOF) technique.}

abstract = {Monolithic scintillators are more frequently used in PET instrumentation due to their advantages in terms of accurate position estimation of the impinging gamma rays both planar and depth of interaction, their increased efficiency, and expected timing capabilities. Such timing performance has been studied when those blocks are coupled to digital photosensors showing an excellent timing resolution. In this work we study the timing behaviour of detectors composed by monolithic crystals and analog SiPMs read out by an ASIC. The scintillation light spreads across the crystal towards the photosensors, resulting in a high number of SiPMs and ASIC channels fired. This has been studied in relation with the Coincidence Timing Resolution (CTR). We have used LYSO monolithic blocks with dimensions of 50 x 50 x 15 mm3 coupled to SiPM arrays (8 x 8 elements with 6 x 6 mm2 area) which compose detectors suitable for clinical applications. While a CTR as good as 186 ps FWHM was achieved for a pair of 3 x 3 x 5 mm3 LYSO crystals, when using the monolithic block and the SiPM arrays, a raw CTR over 1 ns was observed. An optimal timestamp assignment was studied as well as compensation methods for the time-skew and time-walk errors. This work describes all steps followed to improve the CTR. Eventually, an average detector time resolution of 497 s FWHM was measured for the whole thick monolithic block. This improves to 380 ps FWHM for a central volume of interest near the photosensors. The timing dependency with the photon depth of interaction and planar position are also included.}

   abstract = {Deep Learning has become one of the most dominant approaches in Artificial Intelligence research today. Although conventional deep learning techniques have achieved huge successes on Euclidean data such as images, or sequence data such as text, there are many applications that are naturally or best represented with a graph structure. This gap has driven a tide in research for deep learning on graphs, among them Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the most successful in coping with various learning tasks across a large number of application domains. In this chapter, we will systematically organize the existing research of GNNs along three axes: foundations, frontiers, and applications. We will introduce the fundamental aspects of GNNs ranging from the popular models and their expressive powers, to the scalability, interpretability and robustness of GNNs. Then, we will discuss various frontier research, ranging from graph classification and link prediction, to graph generation and transformation, graph matching and graph structure learning. Based on them, we further summarize the basic procedures which exploit full use of various GNNs for a large number of applications. Finally, we provide the organization of our book and summarize the roadmap of the various research topics of GNNs.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are a promising tool for solving the problem of pattern recognition. Most well-known convolutional neural networks implementations require a significant amount of memory to store weights in the process of learning and working. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture in which the neural network is divided into hardware and software parts to increase performance and reduce the cost of implementation resources. We also propose to use the residue number system (RNS) in the hardware part to implement the convolutional layer of the neural network. Software simulations using Matlab 2018b showed that convolutional neural network with a minimum number of layers can be quickly and successfully trained. The hardware implementation of the convolution layer shows that the use of RNS allows to reduce the hardware costs on 7.86\%-37.78\% compared to the two's complement implementation. The use of the proposed heterogeneous implementation reduces the average time of image recognition by 41.17\%.}

abstract = {i-TED consists of both a total energy detector and a Compton camera primarily intended for the measurement of neutron capture cross sections by means of the simultaneous combination of neutron time-of-flight (TOF) and $\gamma$-ray imaging techniques. TOF allows one to obtain a neutron-energy differential capture yield, whereas the imaging capability is intended for the discrimination of radiative background sources, that have a spatial origin different from that of the capture sample under investigation. A distinctive feature of i-TED is the embedded Dynamic Electronic Collimation (DEC) concept, which allows for a trade-off between efficiency and image resolution. Here we report on some general design considerations and first performance characterization measurements made with an i-TED demonstrator in order to explore its $\gamma$-ray detection and imaging capabilities.}
