\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

\paragraph*{HYMNS-ERC}

The work was developed as part of the Gamma-ray and Neutron Spectroscopy group of \ac{IFIC}, under the \ac{HYMNS} project funded by the \ac{ERC}. As such I would like to thank everyone in the group for giving me the opportunity of taking this project and for the guidance and feedback throughout.

\bigskip

\paragraph*{Finding a thesis}

I would like to thank Professor Arias, former coordinator of the \ac{EMJMD-NucPhys}, for putting me in contact with the research groups of \ac{IFIC}. Without your help I wouldn't have been able to undergo this project.
