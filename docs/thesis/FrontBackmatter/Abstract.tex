\chapter*{Abstract}

The upgrade of the multi \ac{i-TED} detector system is presented in this thesis.

The multi \ac{i-TED} is an innovative $\gamma$-ray imaging system consisting of an array of four Compton cameras.

\\~\\~\\

Explain the work and results or introduce the chapters? Both?\\~\\

The current thesis aims at optimizing the background suppression capabilities of the multi \ac{i-TED} detector system. The technical background that the present work is based of is presented in \ref{ch:background}, while the detector itself is described in \ref{ch:detector}, and the main applications are presented in \ref{ch:applications}.\\

The project is therefore divided into two parts.\\

The data-driven upgrade of the \ac{i-TED} modules and the subsequent characterization of its performance, \ref{pt:detector}.\\% Which includes... ?
In comparison to the previous characterization, based on the current work there is an improvement of up to --\% in the singles resolution, --\% in the coincidences resolution, and --\% in the timing resolution.\\

In \ref{pt:approaches}, the different imaging techniques and the background discrimination approaches are presented.\\
