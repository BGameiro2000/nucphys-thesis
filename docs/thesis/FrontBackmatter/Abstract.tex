\chapter*{Abstract}
i-TED is an innovative gamma-ray imaging system which consist on an array of four Compton
cameras. This device exploits the Compton imaging technique to enhance the detection sensitivity
in neutron capture measurements of relevance for nuclear astrophysics carried out at the CERN
n\_TOF facility.\\

In this context, this master thesis proposal aims at characterizing and optimizing at key features of
the detector such as the coincidence resolving time and imaging resolution, as well as studying the
potential application of Machine Learning techniques to enhance the performance of i-TED for
neutron capture experiment
